MOCK:
A mock doesn't retain the behavior(code) of the original class!

SPY:
The thing about spying is that it uses real class.
when we use spy the original behavior of class is retain and we can stub the specific method


WEB MVC TEST:
To unit test a controller we dont need to run the entire application, wo we use WebMvcTest annotation over our test class

to test the restController we use MockMvc
