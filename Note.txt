MOCK:
A mock doesn't retain the behavior(code) of the original class!

SPY:
The thing about spying is that it uses real class.
when we use spy the original behavior of class is retain and we can stub the specific method


WEB MVC TEST:
To unit test a controller we dont need to run the entire application, wo we use WebMvcTest annotation over our test class

to test the restController we use MockMvc



DataJPATest:
DAtaJpaTest can be used with any JPA implementation
It creates the tables and execute the data.sql file for us.
thus it makes our database ready for the test

In typica DataJpaTest all the elements related with the data are launched
1. In memory database is created
2. All the tables are created


To do Integration Testing we use  @SpringBootTest
It launches entire application
It search for its parent packages and looks for @SpringBootAppliation, once found then launch the application
It also in-memory database


If you want your Integration test class to start with specific properties file then you can use @TestPropertySource
 @TestPropertySource(locations = {"classpath: "})
